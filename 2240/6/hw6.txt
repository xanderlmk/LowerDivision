1. The results end up being 0000 0000 because you only have room for 8 bits, even though the result should be 1 000 0000. This is called overflow.

11. MUL treats rs and rt as signed ints and stores the product in rd.
MULTU treats rs and rt as unsigned ints and stores the product in the accumulator HiLo.
MULT treats rs and rt as signed ints and stores the product in the accumulator HiLo.

21. shift right logical on a negative twos complement number loses the sign bit for even a small value, but shift right arithmetic(sra) does not. the sra replicates the sign bit as needed to fill the bit positions emptied by the shift.
